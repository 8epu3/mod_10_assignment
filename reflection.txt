During this assignment I was strugling with the CI/CD portion. Some of the dependencies versions had security vunerabilities. In order to pass the tests and github actions I had to change upgrade some of the dependencies without breaking others. It was a good exercise to experiece becuase i saw first hand what to do once a dependency in the project has a security flaw. This is why test are great. They work as a early warning if an upgraded dependency breaks something within the project.
